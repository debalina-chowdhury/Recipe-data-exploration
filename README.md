# Recipe dataset exploration 

# Aim: 
Exploration of recipe dataset and building a recommendation system based on insights found with the help of data visualization after data preprocessing

# Problems to be addressed: 
What are the most important factors that affect the ratings of a recipe?

How do peopleâ€™s preferences of recipes change over time?

How features such as nutritional value, recipe length etc are changing with time?

# Dataset:
Food.com Recipes dataset (Food.com Recipes and Interactions | Kaggle). The dataset consists of recipe names, steps, ingredients, preparation time, nutritional value, ratings etc from 200k recipes collected over a period of 20+ years. It also contains comments and numerical ratings of 1.1M+ reviews on said collection of recipes.

# Proposed solution and real world application:
As a part of our data analysis, we plan to understand how the food preference of people has changed over time; which features have changed the most and how have they changed? These are a few insights we hope to gain  to answer our research questions.
We plan to make clear visualizations of how features are changing from one year to another and perform multivariate analysis of different combinations of features to figure out factors such as correlation, causation etc.
Health is a very important part of our lives and making smart choices about the food we eat can help us live a healthier and longer life. Through this project we hope to understand food choices of people in order to design a recommendation system based on the factors outlined above.
